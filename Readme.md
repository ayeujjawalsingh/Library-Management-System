<h2 align="center">Description of Library Management System</h2>
<hr>

```
In this Library Management System project, I have implemented a login system with three user types: super admin, staff, and user.
```

## 1. Super Admin Section

```
When logged in as a super admin, the system displays a menu with seven options.

1.Add Staff: This option allows the super admin to add a new staff member to the system. The super admin can enter the staff member's details, such as name, email, and password.
 
2.Add User: This option allows the super admin to add a new user to the system. The super admin can enter the user's details, such as name, email, and password.
 
3.Add Book: This option allows the super admin to add a new book to the library. The super admin can enter details about the book, such as the title, author, and ISBN.
 
4.Remove Book: This option allows the Super Admin to remove a book from the library. The Super Admin can search for a book by its title or ISBN and remove it from the system.
 
5.Remove Staff: This option allows the super admin to remove a staff member from the system. The super admin can search for the staff member by name or email and remove them from the system.
 
6.Remove User: This option allows the super admin to remove a user from the system. The super admin can search for the user by name or email and remove them from the system.
 
7.Check Status of Particular Staff: This option allows the super admin to check the status of a particular staff member. The super admin can search for the staff member by their mobile number and check their status in the system.
 
8.Check Status of Particular User: This option allows the super admin to check the status of a particular user. The super admin can search for the user by their mobile number and check their status in the system.
```

## 2. Staff Section

```
When logged in as a staff member, the system displays a menu with three options.

1.Add: This option allows the staff member to add a new book to the library. The staff member can enter details about the book, such as the title, author name, and quantity of the book.
 
2.Remove: This option allows the staff member to remove a book from the library. The staff member can search for a book by its title and remove it from the system.
 
3.Status: This option allows the staff member to check their status in the system, such as the number of books they have added.
```

## 3. User Section

```
When logged in as a user, the system displays a menu with three options.

1.Book Issue: This option allows the user to issue a book from the library. The user can search for a book by its title and author name and issue it for a certain period.
 
2.Return Book: This option allows the user to return a book to the library. The user can search for a book by its title and author name and return it to the library.
 
3.Status: This option allows the user to check their status in the system, such as the number of books they have issued, returned, and fined.
